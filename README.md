# split-predictive-checks

The ```spc``` package was used to reproduce the experiments for:

Jiawei Li and Jonathan H. Huggins. *Calibrated Model Criticism Using Split Predictive Checks*. 2022.


The package includes functionality to load data, compute single and divided SPCs for conjugate Poisson model, Gaussian location model, two-level hierarchical Gaussian models, run SPCs for real-data examples and compare performance of SPCs to other methods.
